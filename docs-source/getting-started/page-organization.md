## Organization Options

Your pages can be organized in several different ways:

1. [Page groups](#1-page-groups)
2. [Child pages](#2-child-pages)
3. [Page sections](#3-page-sections)

### 1. Page groups

Page groups can be used to group collections of pages that are related to one another.

Pages in the same page group will be displayed together under the same group header in the navigation sidebar.

See {@page Page Groups} for more information.

### 2. Child pages

Pages can also be nested as children of other pages.

> ðŸ’¡ Note that child pages cannot have children of their own.

See {@page Child Pages} for more information.

### 3. Page sections

Page sections serve as a collection of page groups. Page sections can be members of page groups, or children of other pages.

> ðŸ’¡ Navigating to a page group will change which page groups are displayed in the navigation sidebar.

See {@page Page Sections} for more information.

## Page and Group Ordering

Page groups and the pages within them are ordered in your documentation output the same way they are ordered in your configuration.

To change the order in which your pages are rendered in the navigation sidebar, simply reorder the items in configuration.
